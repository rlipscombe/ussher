# ussher

SSH thing, like moul/assh, but with the namespaces reversed, so that tab completion works properly. Also with AWS smarts, so that tab completion works there, too.

It's called uSSHer, because that's kinda like "usher" (as in: to direct someone), and the 30 seconds of searching suggested that it wasn't already used for a project name.

James Ussher is also the Bishop that calculated that the day of creation was October 23, 4004 BC. Not sure if that's relevant.
